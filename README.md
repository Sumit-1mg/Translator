# Language Translator

## Project Description

This project is a Language Translator web application built using the Sanic framework and three public APIs (Lacto API, Rapid API, and Google API). The application allows users to translate text from one language to another and also detect the source language of a given text.

1. Python 3.x
2. Pipenv (for managing Python dependencies)

## Installation

    pipenv install --dev

## Usage

    pipenv shell
2. Start the Sanic server:
